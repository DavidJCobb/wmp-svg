/*
   Ensure that the stylesheet (defs > symbol > style) doesn't affect 
   content in the rest of the SVG or embedding document. The styles 
   will still be receptive to CSS variables set on the shadow host, 
   when this <symbol/> is <use/>d.
   
   Wrapping all of our rules a selector that targets the to-be-<use/>d 
   element by ID will prevent those rules from "bleeding out" of the 
   stylesheet and affecting the rest of the document. A <use/> element 
   creates a shadow DOM, but <symbol/> does not.
   
   Our styles will still work within the <use/> element:
   
   A <use/> element creates an open (but read-only) shadow root and 
   then clones the used content into the shadow DOM. In browsers that 
   properly apply selectors to <use/>d content (i.e. Firefox), the 
   selectors will match based on the clones' positions in the shadow 
   DOM. In this case, the root element in the shadow root will be a 
   clone of the to-be-used element, keeping its ID attribute.
   
   In browsers that improperly apply selectors to <use/>d content 
   (i.e. Chrome and WebKit), the selectors will match based on the 
   original elements' positions in the DOM. In this case, they're 
   inside of the original to-be-used element, which obviously has 
   its own ID.
   
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   We draw fuzzy shapes as nine-slices, using a radial gradient and an 
   edge gradient, because this is (probably) more efficient than using 
   blurs and filters. Each fuzzy shape is a <symbol/> that you can 
   <use/>, setting CSS variables on the <use/> element to control its 
   rendering.
   
   Our preferred option is to generate a <mask/> element with each of 
   our pieces inside, and apply that to a <rect/>. This allows us to 
   avoid sub-pixel rounding issues in browsers, which otherwise cause 
   small "cracks" to appear between parts of our nine-slice; these can 
   appear unpredictably depending on the zoom level. (We set the CSS 
   image-rendering property to a value that reduces their occurrence, 
   but only a <mask/> can get rid of them completely.)
   
   Unfortunately, however, a <mask/> inside of a <use/>d element can't 
   take CSS variables properly in Chrome or WebKit. This is because of 
   two defects in those browsers' SVG2 support (read: they've had over 
   seven years to implement the new spec and they haven't bothered):
   
    - A <use/> element creates an open (but read-only) shadow root and 
      then clones the to-be-used content into the shadow DOM. Browsers 
      that support SVG2 will apply selectors to the cloned elements 
      based on their position within the shadow DOM, but browsers that 
      are non-compliant will instead apply selectors to the cloned 
      elements based on the original elements' positions in the DOM. 
      
    - Browsers that are non-compliant may also choose not to clone any 
      "non-graphical" elements, such as <mask/>, into the shadow DOM. 
      This means that our <rect/> gets cloned but our <mask/> does not. 
      The cloned <rect/> references the original mask, and since the 
      original mask isn't inside of the <use/> element, it doesn't 
      inherit the values of CSS variables set on the <use/> element.
   
   This means that we need to use a mask when possible, but fall back 
   to a non-mask-based approach (and simply accept the rendering bugs 
   that that has) when dealing with non-SVG2-compliant browsers. This 
   is harder than it sounds: there's no @supports rule you can use to 
   check for "does not completely flub the SVG2 DOM," and you can't 
   just use `#my-element:has(mask)` because (per the first bug) that 
   selector would be matched against the original element and the 
   rules would then incorrectly affect the cloned element. If the 
   original element :has a given child or descendant, then the cloned 
   element tests as having it too -- even if it no longer does.
   
   In practice, we have to take the two above defects and use the former 
   to deal with the latter.
   
   If our to-be-used element isn't the :only-child within the normal 
   DOM, then we can use :only-child to match it within the shadow DOM 
   when running in an SVG2-compliant browser: the element's clone will 
   be the sole direct child of a <use/> element's shadow root. In turn, 
   whenever :only-child doesn't match, we know the browser is failing 
   to apply selectors as SVG2 requires. As long as Chrome and WebKit 
   fix BOTH of the above bugs at the same time, or at least fix the 
   second listed bug BEFORE the first bug, we'll be fine.
   
   Let's look at the bright side. Chrome is deeply, deeply frustrating 
   to write SVGs for because it gets so many things wrong. It's highly 
   unlikely that they'll fix these bugs in "the wrong order" because 
   it's highly unlikely that they'll ever bother to fix them at all. 
   They've had nearly a decade to actually handle CSS-in-SVG2 properly 
   and they still don't. We can probably rely on it continuing to be 
   piss-poor at handling SVGs well into the future.
