# To-do

* `WMPlayerElement`
  * We need "disabled" states for the "previous" and "next" buttons (have WMP play a video file in order to see what those look like).
  * The "theater" mode (wherein the player controls are overlaid on the video) uses different glyphs from the normal player &mdash; specifically, white glyphs rather than blue.
  * Timestamp display (to the left of the controls)
  * Clicking and holding on the "next" button should engage fast-forward
  * Clicking and holding on the "prev" button should engage rewind
  * Tooltips for next/fast-forward and prev/rewind
  * Look into a better way to handle the "tray" borders
  * Look into replicating the WMP dark theme for the "tray"
  * Look into offering differing arrangements of buttons
    * Current arrangement
    * Play/pause, seek slider, timestamp, and volume
  * Full-screen toggle button in lower-right corner
* Button glyphs
  * Volume
    * Muted
    * 0%
    * 33%
    * 66%
    * Full
  * Full-screen (enter/exit)
